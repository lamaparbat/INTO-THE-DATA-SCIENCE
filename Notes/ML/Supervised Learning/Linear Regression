Major usecase:

- The major use case of linear regression is to predict a continuous numerical value based on a set of input variables or features. 
  Linear regression is widely used in various fields such as economics, finance, physics, and social sciences for tasks such as:
  
  1. Sales forecasting: Linear regression can be used to forecast sales based on historical sales data and other relevant variables such as advertising expenditure, price, and seasonality.
  
  2. Investment analysis: Linear regression can be used to analyze the relationship between different investment variables such as stock prices, interest rates, and economic indicators.
  
  3. Risk management: Linear regression can be used to analyze the relationship between different risk factors and to predict the potential impact of these risk factors on business operations.
  
  4. Climate modeling: Linear regression can be used to model the relationship between different climate variables such as temperature, precipitation, and atmospheric pressure to predict future climate patterns.
